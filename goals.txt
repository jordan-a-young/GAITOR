Strech Goal:
	-Pickup feet in video

Step Goal:
	-Fix other little things
		-make gui more streamline to have it all go faster

Potential Improvements:
	-Separate cropping and video settings for top and bottom
	-Add rotate

Random stuff:

	--get_Xvel returns mean velocity, output to gui and file
	--calc_Xvel calculates mean velocity
		--Adds new vel to velocity list
		--runs np.mean to calculate new mean
	--calc_vel_pos finds displacement and time to then calculate velocity
		--stored in an array (self.velocity)


To Do:
	reset after trial
		boolean = video_playing
		reset if video_playing == false
		Or just reset function

	rat = black, bg = white

	set default file location to docs or videos
		line 173 testGUI.py

	pickup feet better
		currently getting nan

	put cropping in

	excel file output

	software icon

	keybinding
		might have to write separate function for keybinds that take an event argument
